        <br>True or false:<ol>\
        <li>User-friendly software doesn&#8217;t need documentation.</li>\
        <br><b>False.</b> Well-organized and updated documentation is like a gooey chocolate-chip cookie: it&#8217;s simple, it doesn&#8217;t leave a mess everywhere, and the average person needs it more than you<br>might think.\
        <br><br><li>Good programmers can pretty much, like, figure out what you want. No requirements documents needed.</li>\
        <br><b>False.</b> Developers have enough of their own problems to solve without trying to read your mind. Excellent req-doc skills will make you the most popular boss in the whole cubicle.\
        <br><br><li>I'll just hire some college kid to handle all the writing stuff. No big deal.</li>\
        <br><b>False.</b> You'll hire me. Your product isn't second-class, so don't give it second-class documentation.\

		<span>Quick, poke the nearest programmer and ask if he&#8217;s ever heard of JIRA. Or Altiris. Or Trello. Chances are, he&#8217;s got a favorite and he wishes there was someone around to make it go.\
		<br><br>\
		All programmers love bug tracking systems they don&#8217;t have to manage, because that makes it easier for them to do their job: writing genius code. That invariably leads to better software, happier users and a bigger pizza fund for yourself.</span>\

		<span>What sort of testing are you into? White-box? Black-box? Hey, I&#8217;ll test any box you want. Whatever your preference, the most important box in Quality Assurance is this one:\

        <br><br>Don&#8217;t worry, though. Errors and loopholes fear me. I&#8217;ll hunt them down from within the nether regions of your modules and work with your coders to destroy them forever.</span>\

		<br><br>In other words, I&#8217;m generally useful. I can help you design, build, document and present better software.</span>\

		I&#8217;m a computer enthusiast, a rock-and-roll fan and a kitchen wizard. But most of all, I&#8217;m a writer. I've been writing since I was three years old. It&#8217;s a part of me.\

	<div class='descriptive'>\
		I can translate programmer-speak into grandma-speak. I can translate grandma-speak into bug reports. I can turn release notes into user manuals or user statistics into business requirements. What will it take to document and standardize your software? Whatever it is, I can do it.\
